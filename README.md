# COMP250_A3
Calculator to process simple mathematical expressions

This project was assignment #3 in COMP 250 - Introduction to Computer Science, taught by Professors Martin Robillard and Mohamed Smaoui in Winter 2015 at McGill University.

This project was an exercise in using stacks/queues/data structures and the Shunting-Yard Algorithm, as well as implementing two key concepts - Tokenization and Reverse Polish Notation. There is also significant and informative error checking built into the code, highlighting incorrectly formatted mathematical expressions. This may include misuse of parentheses, illegal operator combination, etc.

The GUI portion of the calculator was implemented by the Professors/TA's. It is not included in the repository as I do not have explicit publishing permission.

The code implementing the expression processing is included in the Calculator.java source file.
